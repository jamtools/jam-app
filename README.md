# Jam App

Use web midi to queue up chords to play on command. Play chords on your midi device (with your limbs) during recording mode, then have them play on your midi device that supports audio output in playback mode. No rhythm is used for recording or playback. The chords will be sustained until you choose to move to another chord or stop playback altogether. Also display the chords on other devices via websockets.
